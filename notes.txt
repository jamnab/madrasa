Startupli.st, Betalist, Erlibird, Earlist are they any good?
I've been trying to get on the list for some of the beta user websites. I haven't had any success to date. Will getting on there actually generate traffic? Is it worth it to pay the small fee? Or are social and other paid channels the best option? Not looking for silver bullet just some realistic user acquisition advice.

SQL

update table
set path = replace(path, 'oldstring', 'newstring') where path = 'oldstring'

UPDATE `posts` SET `tags` = 'tech tutsplus' WHERE `posts`.`link` LIKE 'http://net.tutsplus.com/%'

SELECT link, 
 COUNT(link) AS NumOccurrences
FROM posts
GROUP BY link
HAVING ( COUNT(link) > 1 )

$string = preg_replace('/[\x00-\x1F\x80-\xFF]/', '', $string);
It matches anything in range 0-31, 128-255 and removes it.
